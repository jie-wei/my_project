# Session Log — 2026-02-28

**Session started:** 15:55
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Objective

Continue skill quality review from previous session (2026-02-26). Rename skills, delete redundant agents, fix cross-references, update orchestrator and workflow rules.

## Changes Made

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| 8 skills renamed | Consistent naming: `research-*`, `review-*`, `analyze-*` | User wanted concise, grouped names |
| `reviewer-python.md` agent | Deleted, content → `review-python` skill | Skills = single source of truth |
| `reviewer-proof.md` agent | Deleted, content → `review-details` skill | Same pattern |
| `verifier.md` agent | Deleted (by user) | Orchestrator handles verification inline |
| `review-details/SKILL.md` | Removed Phase 3, Task tool, stale agent ref; added style guardrail | Cleanup from previous session |
| `review-python/SKILL.md` | Created from `reviewer-python.md` agent | New skill with structured output |
| `protocol-orchestrator.md` | Restored as rule with updated skill refs | User wanted it back in rules |
| `workflow-start.md` | Rewritten with routing, filled placeholders | Was still a template |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Added session-start read instruction | User requested |
| `README.md` | Updated rules table, agents/skills descriptions | Stale references |
| `workflow-plan.md` | Updated orchestrator reference | Pointed to deleted rule |
| `domain-reviewer.md` | Updated `reviewer-proof` → `/review-details` | Stale references |

## Incremental Work Log

- Resumed from previous session (context compaction). Applied pending edits to review-details skill (Phase 3 removal, structured output removal, style guardrail).
- User rejected `r-`/`p-` naming convention. Asked for new names directly.
- Renamed 6 skills: data-analysis→analyze-data, research-ideation→research-brainstorm, interview-me→research-ideate, devils-advocate→research-advocate, lit-review→review-literature, proofread→review-proofread.
- Verified no cross-references to old names except settings.json (protected) and historical logs.
- User renamed review-paper→review-manuscript and review-proofread→review-details (2 more renames).
- User asked to compare proofread vs review-paper skills — explained complementary roles (copy editor vs referee).
- Discussed whether to add structured output back to review-details — user wants it for future multi-agent team.
- Explained option B (thin agent wrapper with `skills:` frontmatter) for agent team architecture.
- User did `git reset --hard origin/main` to start clean. Re-applied all renames.
- Created `review-python` skill from deleted `reviewer-python.md` agent. User confirmed deletion of agent.
- User entered plan mode to fix orchestrator. Explored codebase — found `protocol-orchestrator.md` was already migrated to `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`.
- Plan approved: fix 6 files with stale references. All edits applied, verified with grep.
- User provided old `protocol-orchestrator.md` content, asked to put it back in rules. Restored with updated skill refs.
- Updated CLAUDE.md with session-start read instruction per user request.
- Rewrote workflow-start.md with proper routing diagram and filled template placeholders.
- Updated README rules table and descriptions.
- Committed via PR #22, merged, quality report generated (90-95/100 across all files).

## Decisions

- Skills are the single source of truth for review logic. Agents will be thin wrappers via `skills:` frontmatter when multi-agent team is built.
- Both `protocol-orchestrator.md` (rule) and `orchestrator.md` (agent) coexist — rule defines the protocol, agent executes it.
- `compile-latex` and `validate-bib` skills deleted by user (outside this session).
