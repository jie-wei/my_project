# Session Log — 2026-02-26

**Session started:** 09:53
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Objective
Investigate lost auto-memory after project directory rename (my_project → my-project)

## Changes Made

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|

## Incremental Work Log

- Old `my_project` memory directory not found at `~/.claude/projects/`; only `my-project` exists
- Current MEMORY.md (under `my-project` path) has content from 2026-02-25 — hook testing results survived
- Old memory from before the rename is lost (directory was removed or never existed separately)
