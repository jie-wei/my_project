# Session Log — 2026-02-25

**Session started:** 19:32
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Objective
Build remaining clusters from the original template (D → E → F → C), adapted for this economics research project template.

## Context
- Clusters A (context survival hooks) and B (plan→execute→verify loop) are complete
- Per-session logging redesign is complete
- Reference repo at /tmp/claude-code-my-workflow explored — all 4 clusters mapped
- Agreed order: D (exploration lifecycle) → E (research skills) → F (meta/memory) → C (agents)

## Changes Made

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `code/scripts/archive/` | Created (moved from exploration/archive/) | Three-tier structure |
| `docs/archive/` | Created (moved from exploration/archive/) | Three-tier structure |
| `code/src/mypackage/archive/` | Created (new) | Three-tier structure |
| `output/archive/` | Created (new) | Three-tier structure |
| `.claude/rules/exploration-fast-track.md` | New rule | 60/100 threshold, skip plan mode |
| `.claude/rules/exploration-lifecycle.md` | New rule | Promote/archive/revive protocol |
| `.claude/rules/quality-gates.md` | Added exploration rubric | Replaced placeholder |
| `.claude/rules/project-conventions.md` | Rewrote parallel structure section | Three-tier (core/exploration/archive) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Updated folder tree + rules reference | Three-tier + 2 new rules |
| `README.md` | Updated folder tree + exploration workflow tree | Three-tier + full workflow diagram |
| `.claude/rules/plan-first-workflow.md` | Added no-AskUserQuestion, no-ExitPlanMode notes | User preference |

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|
| Three-tier parallel (core/exploration/archive) at same level | Archive nested inside exploration | Symmetric — transitions are just swapping tier name |
| Named subfolders per exploration | Loose files in exploration/ | Each exploration is self-contained, easy to move as unit |
| User-only tier transitions | Claude suggests promotions | User retains full decision power over lifecycle |
| No ACTIVE_PROJECTS.md tracker | Per-exploration tracker file | Session logs already track active work |
| No per-exploration SESSION_LOG.md | Separate log per exploration | Per-session logs already capture incremental work |

## Incremental Work Log

**19:32:** Session started. Explored reference repo, mapped all 4 remaining clusters. Discussed order with user — D → E → F → C confirmed as recommended.
**19:40:** Plan drafted for Cluster D. User feedback: (1) named subfolders per exploration, (2) archive at sibling level not nested.
**19:50:** User: never promote/archive without user's decision. Added to lifecycle rule.
**19:55:** User: add workflow tree to README. Added to plan.
**20:00:** Dependency check — all files referencing exploration/archive mapped. config.py, templates, .gitignore all clean.
**20:05:** Plan approved. Implementing: folder restructure → 2 new rules → 4 edits to existing files.
**20:10:** All 8 tasks complete. Cluster D implemented.

## Open Questions / Blockers

- Plan-first enforcement gap: address as part of F (meta-governance) or separately?
- Clusters E, F, C still pending
