# Quality Report: Merge to Main -- 2026-02-25

## Summary
Fixed two workflow enforcement gaps: added quality report generation to the `/commit` skill (step 7) and added a starter prompt to README that bootstraps plan-first behavior.

## Files Modified
| File | Type | Quality Score |
|------|------|---|
| `.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md` | Config | 95/100 |
| `README.md` | Docs | 95/100 |
| `docs/quality_reports/session_logs/2026-02-25_template_setup.md` | Docs | 90/100 |

## Verification
- [x] Compilation/execution succeeds
- [ ] Tolerance checks PASS (if applicable) — N/A
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable) — N/A
- [x] Quality gates >= 80

## Status
MERGED

## Notes
- `/commit` skill step 7 now generates quality reports at merge time — this is the first report generated by the new workflow
- Starter prompt modeled on pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow README lines 34-42
- Deferred: pre-compact hook fallback to search `~/.claude/plans/` for internal plan files
